# webCollection
Simple web-based collection manager with python back-end

This simple tool should be able to show data from different sources type (.csv files, xlsx, .sqlite) and to make a searchable and filterable html table.

It must allow users to personalise what field have to be shown, what kind of filters are available to interact with data.

Every record might be of different type (i.e.: txt, pdf, doc, xls, images); some kind of bookmarking and tagging will be useful.
